# Password Generator

## Challange

I was challanged to make a password generater to make strong passwords for greater security.

my tasks were as follows:

* WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

* WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 
characters and no more than 128 characters

* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

* WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

* WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

* WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## How it works

There are 2 Password Generators on this page that do the same function. 

The first utalizes prompt(), confirm() and allert() browser prompts to input the correct information needed to generate a password.

The second utalizes check boxes and a number drop down to do the same.

## Features

I tried to go above and beyond the assignment by doing a second password generator. This generator still meets the standard asked by the class, but with further research into how check boxes work and generating the password without using prompts.

## What I Learned

Really enjoyed applying JS to the main pages and it was cool making a full fledged web-app.
