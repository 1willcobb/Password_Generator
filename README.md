# Password Generator

## Challange

## How it works

There are 2 Password Generators on this page that do the same function. 

The first utalizes prompt(), confirm() and allert() browser prompts to input the correct information needed to generate a password.

The second utalizes check boxes and a number drop down to do the same.

## Features

I tried to go above and beyond the assignment by doing a second password generator. This generator still meets the standard asked by the class, but with further research into how check boxes work and generating the password without using prompts.

## What I Learned

Really enjoyed applying JS to the main pages and it was cool making a full fledged web-app.
